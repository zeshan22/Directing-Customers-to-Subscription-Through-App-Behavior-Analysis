# Directing-Customers-to-Subscription-Through-App-Behavior-Analysis
The objective of this model is to predict which users will not subscribe to the paid membership, so that greater marketing efforts can go into trying to 'convert' them to paid users. First i applied exploratory data analysis and plotted the histogram of numerical columns , correlation with response variable ,correlation matrix using Matplotlib and Seaborn. I used pandas and numpy for all of our data formatting steps. I build Logistic Regularization model using L1 regularization and find out accuracy of 77%. Our effort has given us model that will label every new user as 'highly likely' to subscribe.
